In addition to 2.0, the Phalcon Team is also focused on 1.3, a new version that will include new features, important improvements in the overall memory usage and new components like `Phalcon\Image`.

Today, we are announcing the release of Phalcon 1.2.4, a maintenance release including several bug fixes, performance improvements and stability fixes available in the 1.3.0 branch.

This version does not include any new features. The complete [CHANGELOG​](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/1.2.4/CHANGELOG) is ​here.

### Help with Testing

Please help us to test this version to ensure everything is OK before the final release. This version can be installed from the 1.2.4 branch:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd build
git checkout 1.2.4
sudo ./install
```

Windows users can download a DLL from the [download page](https://phalconphp.com/download).
