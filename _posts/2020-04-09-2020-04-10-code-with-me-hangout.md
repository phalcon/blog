We haven't had one of these in a while. Join us tomorrow at 17:00 EST (21:00 UTC) for chit chat as well as some coding!
<!--more-->

This is going to be similar to previous _Code with me_ hangouts we had in the past. No script, just a chat among friends and perhaps some coding, answering questions etc.

The hangout will be held on YouTube here:

Free format, just come and have fun, ask questions, bring beer, chips and wine!

Stay safe and keep coding!
