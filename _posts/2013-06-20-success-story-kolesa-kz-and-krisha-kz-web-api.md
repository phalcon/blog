Success story from our community member [Nikita Vershinin](https://github.com/endeveit):

<!--more-->
> Hello, Phalcon team. 
> 
> I would like to share with you our success story using Phalcon in [kolesa.kz](https://kolesa.kz) and [krisha.kz](https://krisha.kz) projects, [the most visited](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/kolesa.kz) and highloaded sites in Kazakhstan, ranked in TOP-10 classified sites in the CIS. Both sites work on single RESTful-like API written on [Phalcon\\Mvc\\Micro](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/micro).
> 
> On peak loads API processes something like 400 req/sec and this is not a limit. 
> 
> Moving to Phalcon allowed us to reduce response generation time and the consumption of CPU and RAM, as well as to reduce the time of development process. 
> 
> We will continue using Phalcon in our new projects. 
> 
> Thank you for the great work you are doing!
