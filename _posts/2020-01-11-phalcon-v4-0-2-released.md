New release! (same as the one before really)!

<!--more-->

We blame gremlins in the code...

<div><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d5a25d2803c00c5df700423815b036f1b29ff087/ab566/assets/files/gremlins.jpeg" alt=""></div>

Earlier today we released [4.0.1](https://blog.phalcon.io/post/phalcon-v4-0-1-released). Unfortunately, the version of the extension was not updated properly and as a result, `echo phpversion("phalcon")` was returning `4.0.0` instead of `4.0.1`.

Since we have already published the release and do not wish to mess up all the GitHub hashes, we are releasing exactly the same release with a different (and now correct) version number.

You can check the [GitHub tag](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v4.0.2) but in reality the changelog is that of [4.0.1](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v4.0.1).

Apologies for the inconvenience caused!
