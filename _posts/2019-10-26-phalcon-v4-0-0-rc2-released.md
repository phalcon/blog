We are very happy to announce the release of **v4.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 2**!. 

We cannot thank your community enough! We said this before but it is worth repeating: our community is what drives this project forward and makes it better with every release!

{: .alert .alert-info }

This release has not added any more functionality. We have discovered quite a few issues regarding interfaces and some bugs that our awesome community discovered. All of those have been fixed! 

We are now on the final stretch as they say, ready to fix anything that is found between this release and the stable one and 14 documents to revise.

You can see the remaining cards for v4 in our [project](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/projects/3) page. 

Regarding the documents, you can check our progress in this issue:

> In this version we are using Zephir 0.12.10 which enjoys better memory management and stricter type checks.

As far as our sample applications, [Vokuro](https://github.com/phalcon/vokuro) has been upgraded to v4 as well as [REST-API](https://github.com/phalcon/rest-api) and the [basic tutorial](https://github.com/phalcon/tutorial). We will upgrade the forum and invo after v4 is released.
