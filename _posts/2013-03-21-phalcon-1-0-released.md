### Looking forward
There's still more to be done, and although we have come a long way with very few resources, we would love to spend more resources (particularly our time) in improving the framework and the whole ecosystem around it (documentation, tools, support, etc).

Phalcon is an open-source project of driven by voluntary effort. We have dedicated a great amount of our time to bring Phalcon to where it is now and we are really satisfied and excited with the result!

We are also looking for companies/organizations/individuals who would be interested in supporting the project financially, by sponsoring the development and maintenance. This can be done on an ongoing donations schedule, so we the core developers and main contributors can devote more time and resources to the project. Due to this we have introduced [donate links](https://phalconphp.com) to our website. If you are interested in sponsoring us you can use the donate links on our site or contact us directly at [team@phalconphp.com](denied:denied:denied:denied:mail:team@phalconphp.com) for more information.

Finally we will be setting up consulting services offered to the community on a paid basis, so as to offset some of our costs.

### Thanks!!
Finally we want to say a huge thanks to the community, testers, contributors, evangelists and enthusiasts for their continuing support and help on the project.

If you have not tried Phalcon yet, we invite you to try it now!

Enjoy & Have fun!
