We started getting a bit more organized :) We have split the work in sprints (usually two week long) and we only pick up work that we can complete within the current sprint. 

The work is a combination of bug fixes, enhancements as well as NFRs for both 4.0 and 4.1.

## Highlights

* Docs update / clarifications
* Build adjustments (PHP 7.4)
* `Request\Cookie` - `setcookie`
* Size parameter for `DATETIME`/`TIMESTAMP`
* Query Builder - virtual columns
* DevTools bugs
* **PECL work**
* **Codeception Phalcon 4 module**
* Binaries for macOS - HomeBrew
* Docs update / clarifications
* Tests - CLI (all done)
* Tests - `Request\Cookie`

also for v4.1

* JWT support (4.1)  (docs needed)
* `Html\Helpers` support (4.1)  (docs needed)
