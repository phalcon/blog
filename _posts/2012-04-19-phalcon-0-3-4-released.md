We're part of the "speed up the web", therefore, we want to have a rapid release schedule releasing continuous improvements and bug fixes to Phalcon.

The C language has not been designed for rapid development; however, we are putting a lot of enthusiasm to get a better and faster framework.

<!--more-->
Unit-tests and the [continuous integration](http://travis-ci.org/#!/phalcon/cphalcon) server helped us a lot to discover bugs and maintain our repositories stable (during development).

As you know, Phalcon is the fastest framework for PHP out there, so but more importantly than that, we want to get a balance between functionality and performance.

Returning to the subject of this post, in this release, we're proud to announce the following changes:

0.3.4

- Fixed wrong implementation in Phalcon\Tag::javascriptInclude
- Added [Phalcon\Cache\Frontend\Output](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/cache)
- Renamed `Phalcon\Db\Mysql` to `Phalcon\Db\Adapter\Mysql`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Cache\Adapter\File` to `Phalcon\Cache\Frontend\File`
- Added `Phalcon\Request::setRawHeader`
- Added [Phalcon\Paginator\Adapter\Array](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/pagination)
- Fixed pagination bugs in `Phalcon\Paginator\Adapter\Model`
- Added [Phalcon\Tag::hiddenField](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/volt#using-tag-helpers)
- Added [Phalcon\Tag::fileField](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/volt#using-tag-helpers)
- Added [Phalcon\Loader](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/loader) to autoload classes based on some conventions
- Added [Phalcon\Db\Profiler](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/en/whats-next) to profile database operations and determine possible bottlenecks

Framework documentation is also quite complete. [Check it out](https://docs.phalcon.io)
