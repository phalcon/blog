[Václav Slavík](https://github.com/vslavik), the owner of Poedit has recently released version 2.3.

For those that do not know, [Poedit](https://poedit.net) is a very handy editor for translating content that is stored in `po` files.

Thank you to [Václav](https://github.com/vslavik) for the integration!
