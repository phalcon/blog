In an effort to keep the community informed as much as possible, we are going to be holding a community hangout on Saturday the 26th of January 2019, at 12:00:00 EST. We want to talk to the community, listen to the concerns and provide clarifications to areas that the community is potentially struggling. 

We will hold this virtual meeting in a Google Hangout on Air, which will also broadcast it on YouTube to ensure that not only 10 people can attend :)

The format will be:

* Introduction, welcome to all attendees
* Thank you to the whole community and contributors
* Who are we? Brief talk about the team
* v4 introduction and vision
* Topics from the community

For the last point, we need your help. Please visit [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWYxQvg4Ej7VoxQq5nTZAzWwxDSLe9aAQf3N5ul2WmVIvwcw/viewform) and record your opinion so that we can select the most requested topics for discussion.

We will post another blog post with more information as we get closer to the hangout date.

Looking forward to hearing from all of you and seeing you during the hangout. We plan on having one hangout a month, to communicate with the community in a more friendly and direct way.
