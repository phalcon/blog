Time for a financial update for the project.

<!--more-->

We have to apologize for the lack of financial update posts. The last update was in 2020 (:/). With this post we are rectifying the lack of reporting and are posting our financial update for 2023, 2022 and 2021.

We promised to be as transparent as possible with our community and contributors, so that you all know what your contributions are funding.

> You can always check the status of our finances in our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/phalcon) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://phalcon.io/fund) pages at any time.

## 2023 Financial Summary

### Overview
We have a good amount of funds available to us. Right now our account has 11,944.46 USD. As you can see in Open Collective we have been very frugal with the funds, and only used it for certain services or sponsoring certain activities.

### In Detail
In 2023, money was spent paying for computer upgrades for the team, services for the framework, as well as sponsoring work. The next biggest expense was, as always, processing fees and fees for OpenCollective.

All amounts are in USD.
