We cannot thank your community enough! We said this before but it is worth repeating: our community is what drives this project forward and makes it better with every release!

[Github Tag](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.1)

As we are getting closer to the stable version of v4, this release has addressed a good number of outstanding issues, but also bugs found during testing. We only have one actual issue to resolve for v4 and 33 documents to revise.

You can see the remaining cards for v4 in our [project](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/projects/3) page. 

Regarding the documents, you can check our progress in this issue:

[https://github.com/phalcon/docs/issues/2322](https://github.com/phalcon/docs/issues/2322)

> In this version we are using Zephir 0.12.4 which offers a lot stricter type checks. As a result we have discovered a lot of interface to class misalignments and have fixed them.

We are also working to upgrade all of our sample applications to v4. [Vokuro](https://github.com/phalcon/vokuro) is nearly completed (minor enhancements remain such as code coverage) and work is already underway for [phalcon-api](https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-api).
