Today we're pleased to announce the first release-candidate for Phalcon 2.0. This release has been quite a while in the making, and includes new features, improvements and a cleanÂ and friendly code base.

As with all pre-release packages, this is not for production use. But if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and fix bugs (which should be reported to the issue tracker).

We're also preparing a new website and documentation for your joy.

This version can be installed from the 2.0.0 branch, if you don't have [Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com) installed follow these instructions:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout 2.0.0
cd ext
sudo ./install
```

If you have [Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com) installed:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout 2.0.0
zephir build
```

It's almost here!
