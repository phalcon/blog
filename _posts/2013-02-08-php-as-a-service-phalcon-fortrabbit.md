This is a short post to remind you that [Phalcon 0.9.0](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/phalcon-framework-0-9-0-released) is officially supported by [Fortrabbit.](http://fortrabbit.com/) So if you need to install applications created in Phalcon, you can take advantage of this provider.

This is [INVO](http://phalcon-test.eu1.frbit.net) running there in the free plan.

Check out this [article](http://phpmaster.com/php-as-a-service-fortrabbit/) highlighting some of its great features. If you know other hosting companies supporting Phalcon out of the box share them with the community.
