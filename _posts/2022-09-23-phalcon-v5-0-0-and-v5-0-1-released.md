A﻿ long journey has come to an end and looking forward to our new journey ahead. Phalcon v5.0.0 (and v5.0.1) has been released!

<﻿!--more-->

W﻿e started v5 at the end of May 2020. Two years and change later, ~2,663 commits and ~760 issues/cards on GitHub, we are happy to announce that v5.0.0 stable is available for our community.

T﻿he changes to the framework are too many to list in a single blog post. We have compiled a thorough upgrade document in our documentation website, that developers can use to upgrade their applications:

h﻿ttps://docs.phalcon.io/5.0/en/upgrade

P﻿S: We also made the search work for the docs AND it is version and language aware! /win

A﻿ huge thank you to all of the members of our community. Your comments, PRs and suggestions have helped us make this release a reality.

T﻿he best part was that we released yesterday v5.0.0, this morning a bug was discovered and we had to release v5.0.1. Thank you [@levertr](https://github.com/levertr) for reporting it!

O﻿ur full changelog for this release is located here:

T﻿he release is available in PECL and the IDE stubs have been generated. We will make the necessary upgrades to the supporting repositories (Vokuro, devtools etc.) this week.

O﻿nce again, huge thanks to our community!
