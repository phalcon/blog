### Community 
Big kudos to our community as always for reporting, suggesting and applying fixes and making our framework better with every release! A big thank you to all our backers and supporters that help us by joining our funding campaign. [https://phalcon.link/fund](https://phalcon.link/fund)

### Team
We are making some changes to our team, bringing more people in to help with the organization, management as well as structure of the project. Our end goals are to produce timely releases with zero or minimal bugs, and to implement new features regularly. This is still work in progress, so once we have everything settled, we will explain everything with a relevant blog post.

### Update/Upgrade

Phalcon 3.1.0 can be installed from the `master` branch, if you don't have Zephir installed follow these instructions:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon/build
sudo ./install
```

Note that running the installation script will replace any version of Phalcon installed before.

[PackageCloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/phalcon/stable) has been updated to allow your package manager (for Linux machines) to upgrade to the new version seamlessly.
