A brief status update on the project and v4.
<!--more-->
We are continuing our efforts to address bugs with the latest v4.beta.2. Several bugs have been found (mostly interface misalighments) and have been addressed.

### Sample Apps
Kudos to [@Jeckerson](https://github.com/jeckerson) who has been helping with [Vokuro](https://github.com/phalcon/vokuro), porting the sample application to v4, while at the same time introducing automation, tests and additional fixes. [@Jeckerson](https://github.com/jeckerson) will be soon focusing on the [phalcon-api](https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-api), our REST sample implementation.

### Administration
[@ruudboon](https://github.com/ruudboon) has been helping with organization and interacting with the community. There are a lot of _admin_ tasks that we have not been able to address until now, so his help is invaluable.

### Uptrends/Status page
We have a new supporter! [Uptrends](https://uptrends.com) has been kind enough to offer us a free plan to monitor all of our sites. Uptrends Uptrends is the ultimate monitoring tool to stay in control of the uptime, performance, and functionality of your websites, APIs, and servers.

If you find yourself not being able to load one or more of our sites, you can check our [Status Page](https://phalcon.link/status) to ensure that all is well or if there is an issue.

### Documentation
Finally our work on the documents is continuing. We have just finished the PSR-7 and PSR-17 documents. You can check for instance the PSR-7 Request [here](https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/http-request) and the rest of the documents can be found under the PSR menu on the right side.

We welcome any corrections or questions regarding these documents. Updating the documentation and making it perfect is an ongoing process so if you feel that something is not correct or even if you find a typo, all you need to do is open a pull request in our [docs](https://github.com/phalcon/docs) repository for the English language (`en` folder) with your corrections.
