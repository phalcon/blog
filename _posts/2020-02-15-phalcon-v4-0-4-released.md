We are very happy to announce the release of Phalcon **v4.0.4**, a maintenance release. 

<!--more-->

[Github Tag](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v4.0.4)

This release focused mostly on bug fixes reported by the community, as our testing suite and release tasks.

We have started utilizing more [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/actions) in order to streamline our release process. At the moment, every release takes between 2-3 hours with a lot of manual checks from the team to ensure that everything is OK. 

With this release we have added the foundation to start running our tests with GitHub actions on Linux, MacOS and Windows, ensuring that the release will be problem free on all platforms.

We have also started refactoring all our database related tests, with a goal to run all of them on each RDBMs that we support. At the moment we only have MySQL and Sqlite enabled but Postgresql will be added soon. A new testing suite (`database`) was created just for that.

Finally, we worked a bit more on [v4.1](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/4.1.x/CHANGELOG-4.1.md), adding more components as per our roadmap. These components include more HTML helpers under `Phalcon\Html\Helper`, HTTP/2 preload support from Volt as well as a new `Connection` class which is the first step for our Data Mapper implementation coming in later versions of v4. The bulk of the work being done in v4.1 comes from the [NFR list](https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/new-feature-request-list) that the community has voted on.

Huge thanks to our contributors that reported issues, offered input as well as submitted pull requests with additions and corrections!
