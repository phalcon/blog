I'm happy to announce the release of my article dedicated to Phalcon, in the December issue of a German magazine called PHP Magazin.

<!--more-->

Phalcon is even on the front page with a dedicated illustration!

The title of the article is **Der Falke under den PHP Frameworks** - **The Phalcon among the PHP frameworks**. 

The [article](https://kiosk.entwickler.de/php-magazin/php-magazin-1-2021/der-falke-unter-den-php-frameworks/) is thirteen pages long.
Inside, I am presenting Phalcon as well as showcasing its main features.

You can find this issue on [the magazine's website.](https://kiosk.entwickler.de/php-magazin/php-magazin-1-2021/).

Thanks for your attention! I hope this article will contribute to increase Phalcon's community.
