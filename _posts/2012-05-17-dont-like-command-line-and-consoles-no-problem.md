A couple of weeks a friend from Mexico, suggested us to create an alternative interface to Phalcon Developer Tools. It is true, some people have a hate relationship with the commend console ;).

Today we are releasing the Phalcon Developer Tools in a web based flavor, our WebTools. WebTools offer the same functionality as the Developer Tools, but now have a beautiful web interface, allowing you to be more productive without extra complications or effort learning commands.

Additional to well known commands, Web Tools provide editing facilities, so you can instantly check generated code, and edit it without leaving your browser!.

Paranoid Parrot Note: WebTools is optional and for security reasons it can only be accessed from localhost.

Let's figure out how it works with this screencast.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to provide feedback. 

We appreciate it!
