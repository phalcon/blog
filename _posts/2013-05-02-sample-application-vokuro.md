[Vökuró](https://vokuro.phalconphp.com/), is our new sample application to showcase the features of Phalcon. ​We implemented several features related to authorization​, authentication ​ and security. Some of the​se features have recently been introduced in the framework. This sample application ​provides a basic frontend and a backend where users/profiles/security can be managed.

The following features are implemented:

- Sign Up of Users
- Confirmation by email
- Login of Users
- Login throttling
- Registering of invalid logins
- Registering of successful logins
- Password hashing
- "Remember me" option
- Password recovery
- Change password
- Profile/Roles management
- Permission management by profile
- Templates for emails

Other features/examples:

- Full namespaced application
- Volt powered
- Custom user components
- Full use of the Forms builder and Validation components

​To run/test this sample application you will need [Phalcon 1.1.0 beta 3](https://phalconphp.com/download) or ​higher. You can see an online version [here](https://vokuro.phalconphp.com).

You can clone the code from [Github](http://github.com/phalcon/vokuro). We welcome all the improvements to this sample as pull requests. We hope this application serve as example and help to develop your own applications with Phalcon.
