As discussed in the past, we are posting financial updates for each year, so that the contributors know where their contributions go. This is the 2020 financial summary.

> You can always check the status of our finances in our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/phalcon) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://phalcon.io/fund) pages at any time.

## Overview
We have a good amount of funds available to us. Right now our account has 8,847.84 USD. As you can see in Open Collective we have been very frugal with the funds, and only used it for certain services or sponsoring certain activities.

## In Detail
2020 has been an _interesting_ year for most of us, with the lock downs, people losing their jobs etc. The focus shifted from  Open Source code to our families mostly, to get through these times. 

2020 was the first time members of the team received some funds as financial aid for their contributions. Each of the 4 core members at the time received 2,000 USD. 

We have also invested a bit over $2,000.00 USD for Anton's new computer, which will be used primarily in development as well as streaming/video producing. Our intention in 2021 is to increase our streams and videos to better help the community

For the information below, *net income* reflects the money that are available for the project, while *collected* reflects the money that has been paid by contributors. The difference is to cover the fees of Open Collective as well as Credit Card processors etc.

All amounts are in USD.
