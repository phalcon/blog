Last month, important improvements to support PHP7 have been done by the [Zephir Team](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir), so we expect to have a usable version of Phalcon for PHP7 soon.

### Update/Upgrade

This version can be installed from the master branch, if you don't have Zephir installed follow these instructions:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon/build
sudo ./install
```

If you have Zephir installed:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
