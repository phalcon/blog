Today, we have an important announcement to make. A few weeks ago we received an interesting proposal from an important japanese video-game company. They wanted us to create a game that would help children to become interested in web programming including open source alternatives like Phalcon. We are no way video game experts, but we decided to give it a try and the result is simply amazing.

"Pokémon: Phalcon Edition" is a new member of this saga and it is sure to be one of the favorite of its fans.

The spokesman of this company was very excited about this new project:

> We never doubted that Phalcon Team could get on track with this new project. 
> We have rescued the art of Pokémon battle in 2D, but we have introduced 
> elements of the web programming world. 
>
> This game will include a new Framework Pokemon type, the 19th type of Pokemon 
> to be introduced to the franchise. The Framework type is super effective 
> against bugs and bad programming practices.
>
> I can't say more but It will certainly be one of the most exciting games of 
> this year!

A sample of the progress of the game can be seen in the following video:

The game will be available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-games/id6014?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store) starting this summer!

Enjoy!

**Update: No Pokemons were harmed in the making of that video, that was our April Fool's Joke LOL :D**
