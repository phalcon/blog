We are very happy to announce the release of Phalcon **v4.0.5**, a maintenance release. 

<!--more-->

[Github Tag](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v4.0.5)

This release focused mostly on bug fixes reported by the community, as our testing suite and release tasks.

We have also started refactoring all our database ensuring that there are no skipped tests. Also [Jérémy PASTOURET - @jenovateurs](https://github.com/jenovateurs) has been submitting invaluable contributions towards enabling our database testing suite to run with PostgreSQL.

Finally, we worked a bit more on [v4.1](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/4.1.x/CHANGELOG-4.1.md), adding more components as per our roadmap. The work was mostly focused on the Data Mapper implementation coming in later versions of v4. The bulk of the work being done in v4.1 comes from the [NFR list](https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/new-feature-request-list) that the community has voted on.

Huge thanks to our contributors that reported issues, offered input as well as submitted pull requests with additions and corrections!
