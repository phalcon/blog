This release fixed quite a few bugs (thanks community!). We have also introduced support for [PSR-13](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-13), ability to build Hypermedia Links

We are nearly there. 5 documents left to rewrite, a bit of work on DevTools and fixing a few bugs that were found in the previous iteration.

You can see the remaining cards for v4 in our [project](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/projects/3) page. 

Regarding the documents, you can check our progress in this issue:
