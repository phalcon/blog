A brief status update on the project and v4.
<!--more-->
Sadly our progress has been slowed a bit more.

Due to medical reasons Nikos will need to take a brief break for a few weeks. Serghei has managed to pick up a bit of the tasks, splitting his time between Zephir and Phalcon.

We would like to thank the whole community for stepping up and offering solutions, pull requests and comments on the code. Special note to [@Jeckerson](https://github.com/jeckerson) and [@ruudboon](https://github.com/ruudboon) for their help on the various repositories.

We will post additional updates in the very near future.
