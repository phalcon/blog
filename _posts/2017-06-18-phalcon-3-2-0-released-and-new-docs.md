Hello everyone and Happy Father's day!

For our Father's day present, we are extremely happy to announce the release of our newest Phalcon version: 3.2.0.

Our Github issues page has well over 600 issues. However those are mostly New Feature Requests (NFRs), so we started clearing up more and more bugs as well as introducing suggested NFRs. Of course all this would not be feasible without the help of our amazing community: **Thank you**!

### Documentation
Also as part of our goals for Q2, we are releasing our new documentation. We have been working hard to convert all the `rst` files (reStructuredText) to `md` (Markdown) and also have a first pass on identifying inconsistencies and enhancing the documentation. Of course a lot more is needed on that, but it will come in future versions.

We are now using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/phalcon-documentation) to help contributors translate our documents. The docs website has been updated but still needs a little bit of love with the stylesheet (coming very soon). Also you will note that the site mentions version 3.1; we will fix that this week coming to ensure that every document is properly versioned in Crowdin.

Our new documentation needs admittedly a little bit of fine tuning in terms of the CSS and the menus. This will be done in the upcoming week. Also, we are going through all the documents and ensuring the content is correct and accurate throughout. Examples and new functionality of new releases will also be added from now on, before we release so that the documents are up to date always.
