We are happy to announce a new partnership between [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?utm_medium=opensource&utm_source=phalcon) and Phalcon!

<!--more-->
We have been in touch with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?utm_medium=opensource&utm_source=phalcon) for quite some time now, and through those discussions we were able to apply and get approved for their [Open Source Project sponsorship](https://do.co/oss-sponsorship?utm_medium=opensource&utm_source=phalcon).

The resources that [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?utm_medium=opensource&utm_source=phalcon) has allocated for Phalcon will help the project expand, offering (and not limited to):
- machines for storing and collecting benchmarks at any iteration of the framework
- bots necessary for our [Discord](https://phalcon.io/discord) server
- sample applications to showcase "how-to"
- and much more

We would like to thank [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?utm_medium=opensource&utm_source=phalcon) for their generous sponsorship and looking forward to years of collaboration with them.
