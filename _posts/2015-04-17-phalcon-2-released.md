The wait is over! Phalcon 2.0 is here!

After more than a year of development, we're extremely excited to announce the release of Phalcon 2.0 (final).

Those that have been following the project closely, know that this has not been a small feat.

<!--more-->
- We had to create a brand new language [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com) which allows developers to write PHP extensions easily.
- We had to completely rewrite most of Phalcon 1.3.x, offering the same functionality as before so as to ensure that upgrading will be very easy.
- Zephir had to be adjusted and enhanced as we moved through the rewrite, offering more functions and options to developers.
- Additional features were implemented for 2.0, mostly thanks to our contributors!

The results are something that we are very proud of:

- Phalcon 2.0, offering compatible functionality (and more) as before
- [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com), allowing developers to write their own extensions easily without the need to know C.

### Installation

This version can be installed from the master branch, if you don't have [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com) installed follow these instructions:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon/ext
sudo ./install
```

The standard installation method also works:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon/build
sudo ./install
```

If you have [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com) installed:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon
zephir build
```

Note that running the installation script will replace any version of Phalcon installed before.

Windows DLLs are available in the [download page](https://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows).

See the [upgrading guide](https://blog.phalconphp.com/post/guide-upgrading-to-phalcon-2) for more information about installing and updating to Phalcon 2.

### What's next

Our release schedule will be every one or two months (unless we need to issue a security fix, which will be near instant). The target will be the most requested features by the community, although with [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com), contributing to Phalcon will be a breeze. We can't wait to see those pull requests coming in :)

Smaller changes and fixes that can be bundled in a minor version will be released as soon as we can. We will also be working on a LTS (Long Term Support) model for our community.

Finally we are going to start the research on PHP 7, so that we can adjust [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com) accordingly and of course Phalcon. This task will require a lot of preparation and work but we have our targets set on it due to the new functionality and features it offers.

### Conclusion and acknowledgments

We are super excited about this release and are looking forward to the future. A big thank you to all the contributors and donors! We could not have done this without you.
