Some of you have asked us: Why the framework was called Phalcon?, and we're happy to respond.

We look ourselves as a strange kind of geek personality that make a point to be environmentally friendly (not convinced yet being hipster), so we love nature as you can tell our logo obviously represents a falcon!

Coincidentally, a bird, more specifically the [Peregrine Falcon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon), is renowned for its speed, reaching over 322 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member of the animal kingdom!

So PHP + Falcon = Phalcon, Simple. Fast. Easy.
