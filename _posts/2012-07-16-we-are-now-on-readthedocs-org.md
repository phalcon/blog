As we continue to enhance Phalcon with new functionality and features, we have migrated all of our documentation on [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/), a service that hosts documentation for open source projects such as ours.

Utilizing this service allows for:

<!--more-->
- Easy exporting the documentation to other formats like PDF or ePub
- Managing the documentation for each release, independent of one another
- Supporting additional languages (other than English) for the documentation
- Consistency checking, ensuring that there are no broken links or missing images and much more.

This move required a total rewrite of the documentation, from PHP and HTML, to [reStructuredText](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html), a format that is independent of the code base and allows generation of the documentation to different formats.

[Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/) is not yet considered the official documentation, since it is not complete. It does however serve as a quick reference for development. Our goal is to have the documentation as complete as possible prior to our next major release 0.5.x.

A new [github repository](https://github.com/phalcon/docs) has been created to manage the documentation. Every time anyone commits a change, [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/) automatically downloads and rebuilds the documentation, ensuring that it is up to date with the latest developments.

**What's next?**
If you have some extra time, we invite you to take a look at the [new documentation](https://docs.phalconphp.com) and share your thoughts with us. If you find a typo, want to improve a section, wish to see something new that we have not covered, feel free to fork the repository and send us the changes via pull request.

Enjoy the new documentation system!
