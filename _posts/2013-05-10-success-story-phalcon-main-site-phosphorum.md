Our main [website](https://phalconphp.com) and the [forum](https://forum.phalconphp.com) are powered by Phalcon Framework, both are open sourced and published on [Github](https://github.com/phalcon/forum), you can use them as example to create your own applications or if you want to see how real websites perform with Phalcon.
