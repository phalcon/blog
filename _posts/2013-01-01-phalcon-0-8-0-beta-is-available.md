After the introduction of many new and exciting features in our [alpha version](/post/phalcon-0-8-0-alpha-available), we are today releasing the first beta version of 0.8.0.

- [Documentation](https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/0.8.0/)
- Check the complete [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/0.8.0/CHANGELOG)

**Help with Testing**
This version can be installed from the 0.8.0 branch:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd build
git checkout 0.8.0
sudo ./install
```

Windows users can download a DLL from the [download page](https://phalconphp.com/download).

All tests are passing on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/phalcon/cphalcon/builds/3906272), so there should not be any major issues with this version. This version is very close to what will be the final release. 

Please help us to test and report any bugs or problems on [Github](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon). If you have any questions about functionality, feel free to ask either in [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phalcon?sort=newest&pagesize=15) or in our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/phalcon).

We hope you like these updates! Have a great start of year!
