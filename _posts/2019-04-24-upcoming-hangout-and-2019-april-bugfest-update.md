Happy Wednesday everyone! Half way through the week!

### Bugfest
Plenty of pull requests have been approved and merged already. The pull requests are mostly code quality enhancements, some bug fixes and performance enhancements. We also have good traction in our documentation with translations, as well as work on the devtools and incubator repositories.

Keep up the good work community!!!

For those that missed it, during April 2019, anyone can contribute to our repositories. You can visit our [cphalcon](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon) repository, start working on a bug or a feature and once done, submit a pull request with your code. You can also visit our [documentation](https://github.com/phalcon/docs) repository to help with the documentation, [devtools](https://github.com/phalcon/devtools) or [incubator](https://github.com/phalcon/incubator) or if you prefer to help with the translating the Phalcon documentation in your native tongue by visiting our project in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/phalcon-documentation).

Everyone that helps us during April Bugfest, will receive a T-Shirt and some stickers as a thank you from the team!

### Hangout
This weekend, Saturday 27th of April at 12:00 EST (16:00 UTC) we will have our monthly community hangout. More information on that in a future blog post.

### Thank you!
