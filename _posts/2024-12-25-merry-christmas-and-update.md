The Phalcon Team wishes all of our friends, contributors, developers and users of the framework a Merry Christmas!. 
We hope that the new year will bring health and happiness to you and your loved ones!

Sadly, we are not following the tradition of previous years with a new release for Phalcon. We hoped that we were going to be able to have something ready but we could not make it this year.

First and foremost: 

> A huge thank you to all of our contributors and the community!!

You have all been very generous with your time, proposing fixes, finding bugs, discussing functionality. We are as always grateful for your help.

No release this Christmas :/

We tried but were not able to make it. There has been ongoing work to provide support for PHP 8.4 and that starts from Zephir first. The work thre has not been completed and as such we cannot build a new Phalcon release at the moment. This will of course be addressed but for now we are a bit stuck. 

We have also worked on the parsers for v6. [@Jeckerson](https://github.com/jeckerson) finished the work for Volt and v6 is now using a PHP version of that parser. He has been working on PHQL but it is tedious work to make that conversion so it is not ready yet. Hopefully early next year we will have that one as well as the annotations ready, so that we can release an v6.0.0 alpha.


## Thank you
Once again **a huge thank you to our community**!
