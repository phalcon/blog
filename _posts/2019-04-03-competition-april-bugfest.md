Welcome to Phalcon's April Bugfest!!!

**April Bugfest** is a month long event, aimed to re-energize the community and squash bugs as fast as possible, that remain for Phalcon v4.

### Overview
During April 2019, anyone can contribute to our repositories. You can visit our [cphalcon](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon) repository, start working on a bug or a feature and once done, submit a pull request with your code. You can also visit our [documentation](https://github.com/phalcon/docs) repository to help with the documentation, [devtools](https://github.com/phalcon/devtools) or [incubator](https://github.com/phalcon/incubator) or if you prefer to help with the translating the Phalcon documentation in your native tongue by visiting our project in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/phalcon-documentation).

### Rewards
Everyone that helps us during April Bugfest, will receive a T-Shirt and some stickers as a thank you from the team!

### Rules etc.
- Nothing beats quality. We welcome quality code with a serious focus on performance, so any pull requests must keep those two points in mind
- Anyone can contribute as much or as little as they want. Multiple submissions do not equal multiple rewards.
- Please be original i.e. do not take someone else's work in a different PR and present it as your own.
- Please do not issue PRs only for some cosmetic issues i.e. removing whitespace etc. Those will not count.

This is our first year starting this competition and we hope to make this a tradition. The actual idea came from [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) and their Hactoberfest, so we thought we could try it and see what happens :)

Thank you to all and if you have any questions, feel free to visit us on our [Discord](https://phalcon.link/discord) server.
