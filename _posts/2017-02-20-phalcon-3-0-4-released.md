### PHP 7.1 and Zephir

We are still working on identifying all the changes that PHP 7.1 has and how it affects Zephir. 

A big thank you to all our backers and supporters that help us by joining our funding campaign. [https://phalcon.link/fund](https://phalcon.link/fund)

### Update/Upgrade

Phalcon 3.0.4 can be installed from the `master` branch, if you don't have Zephir installed follow these instructions:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon/build
sudo ./install
```

Note that running the installation script will replace any version of Phalcon installed before.

[PackageCloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/phalcon/stable) has been updated to allow your package manager (for Linux machines) to upgrade to the new version seamlessly.

Windows DLLs are available in the [download page](https://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows).

We encourage existing Phalcon 3 users to update to this maintenance version.
