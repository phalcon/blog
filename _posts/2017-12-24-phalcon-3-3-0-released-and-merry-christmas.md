#### Highlights
The most notable additions are support for `switch/case` syntax in Volt, `hasHeader` in Request and the addition of the `router:beforeMount` event.

#### `switch/case`
You can now use the `switch` statement in Volt

```twig
{% raw %}
{% switch foo %}
    {% case 0 %}
    {% case 1 %}
    {% case 2 %}
        "foo" is less than 3 but not negative
        {% break %}
    {% case 3 %}
        "foo" is 3
        {% break %}
    {% default %}
        "foo" is {{ foo }}
{% endswitch %}
{% endraw %}
```

The switch statement executes statement by statement, therefore the `break` statement is necessary in some cases. Any output (including whitespace) between a switch statement and the first case will result in a syntax error. Empty lines and whitespaces can therefore be cleared to reduce the number of errors [see here](http://php.net/control-structures.alternative-syntax).

**`case` without `switch`**
```twig
{% raw %}
{% case EXPRESSION %}
{% endraw %}
```
Will throw `Fatal error: Uncaught Phalcon\Mvc\View\Exception: Unexpected CASE`.

**`switch` without `endswitch`**
```twig
{% raw %}
{% switch EXPRESSION %}
{% endraw %}
Will throw `Fatal error: Uncaught Phalcon\Mvc\View\Exception: Syntax error, unexpected EOF in ..., there is a 'switch' block without 'endswitch'`.
```

**`default` without `switch`**
```twig
{% raw %}
{% default %}
{% endraw %}
```
Will not throw an error because `default` is a reserved word for filters like `{% raw %}{{ EXPRESSION | default(VALUE) }}{% endraw %}` but in this case the expression will only output an empty char '' .

**nested `switch`**
```twig
{% raw %}
{% switch EXPRESSION %}
  {% switch EXPRESSION %}
  {% endswitch %}
{% endswitch %}
{% endraw %}
```

Will throw `Fatal error: Uncaught Phalcon\Mvc\View\Exception: A nested switch detected. There is no nested switch-case statements support in ... on line ....`

**a `switch` without an expression**
```twig
{% raw %}
{% switch %}
  {% case EXPRESSION %}
      {% break %}
{% endswitch %}
{% endraw %}
```

Will throw `Fatal error: Uncaught Phalcon\Mvc\View\Exception: Syntax error, unexpected token %} in ... on line ....`

#### `hasHeader` in `Phalcon\Http\Request`
You can now use the `hasHeader` method, to check if a header has been set in the incoming request.

```php
if ($request->hasHeader('myheader')) {
    echo 'Yay! Header was set!!';
}
```

#### `router:beforeMount`
Sometimes it is necessary to attach some logic to our application, before the routes are mounted in our `Router` object. The `beforeMount` event is perfect in these cases. You can now use it if your application requirements dictate so.

### Update/Upgrade
Phalcon 3.3.0 can be installed from the `master` branch, if you don't have Zephir installed follow these instructions:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
cd cphalcon/build
sudo ./install
```

Note that running the installation script will replace any version of Phalcon installed before.

[PackageCloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/phalcon/stable) has been updated to allow your package manager (for Linux machines) to upgrade to the new version seamlessly.

<h5 class="alert alert-danger">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Our packaging system not longer supports Ubuntu 15.10 due to difficulties installing dependencies, updates and major security patches. Ubuntu 15.10 reached its end of life in July 28, 2016. We strongly recommend you upgrade your installation. If you cannot, you can always build the latest stable version of Phalcon from the source code.

<h5 class="alert alert-danger">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Windows DLLs are now available in our <a href="https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v3.3.0">Github Release</a> page.
</h5>

We encourage existing Phalcon 3 users to update to this version.
