It has been quite a while since we run our benchmarks against other networks. Actually the last time we had the benchmarks in our documentation was for Phalcon 1.3! Yes we know, we have been neglecting this.

Hopefully this post will offer some perspective on what you can expect from Phalcon and your application. It goes without saying that every application needs the best design for its needs, but using Phalcon can also push your application's performance even further.

<!--more-->
### Methodology
We have installed the stock application for each framework. We have ensured that there is one route, one controller and one view that will allow us to display `Hello World` on the screen. Naturally, this is not a real life example, but it demonstrates the minimum resources needed to display a simple string on the screen.

<h5 class="alert alert-danger">
Note: These are the stock applications that each framework offers. The only thing that we changed is to put each framework in <code>Production</code> mode.
</h5>

This benchmark only measures the time it takes for each framework to start, run each action, present the result needed and free up the resources at the end of the request. Any PHP application based on the said framework will need this time and resources. It is safe to assume that any implementations that will be much more complex than this one will require additional resources per request.

The [ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/programs/ab.html) benchmarking tool from Apache was used for these tests. 1,000 requests using 5 concurrent connections for each framework.

### Results
We will start with the results of our benchmark. The hardware used, raw data as well as setup/configuration changes we did for each framework are further down in this post.

#### Included Files
We have used the [get_included_files()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-included-files.php) function to figure out how many files have been included for one request. The call to the function was at the end of the entry point, usually `index.php` (lower is better).

![image](/assets/files/2017-04-13-files-per-request.png)

#### Memory used (KB)
We have used the [memory_get_usage()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.memory_get_usage.php) function to figure out how many much memory was used for each request. The call to this function was at the end of the entry point, usually `index.php`. (lower is better).

![image](/assets/files/2017-04-13-memory-per-request.png)

#### Requests per Second (mean)
Using the [ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/programs/ab.html) tool, we measured the requests per second that each framework could handle.  (higher is better).

![image](/assets/files/2017-04-13-requests-per-second.png)


#### Time to complete 1,000 requests
Again using the [ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/programs/ab.html) tool, we measured the time it took to complete 1,000 requests.  (lower is better).

![image](/assets/files/2017-04-13-requests-time.png)


### Conclusion
Phalcon is clearly outperforming any other framework in this test. 

Again we will stress out that these are just the stock applications that come with each framework. The results will definitely vary based on your installation. For instance a developer could remove services from a particular framework which will speed it up (at least the included files) but could also add more services which would slow it down.

Nothing beats a good design or better yet, the best design for the application needs. However, if you can gain some performance and lower your memory consumption by just using Phalcon, it is worth a look and a try if you haven't done so already <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.

<h5 class="alert alert-danger">
If any of our readers have suggestions that we could implement to make this benchmark as realistic as possible, feel free to issue a pull request with your suggestions.

<h5 class="alert alert-info">
The last benchmark that one can find is from <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r13&hw=ph&test=json&l=4fthbz">TechEmpower</a> which was conducted on November 16, 2016. According to their test schedule, we should have seen round 14 in February this year but that has not happened yet.

#### Github Repo
[Framework Benchmarks](https://github.com/phalcon/framework-bench)

#### Hardware
I set up a virtual machine with Ubuntu Server 16.10. We stopped the X server and allocated 4GB of RAM and 50GB of hard drive space.

After the system was updated to the latest packages, Apache was installed on the virtual machine. For PHP and Phalcon we chose to use PHP 7.1 using the PPA from [Ondřej Surý](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej).

#### PHP
##### Version
```bash
PHP 7.1.3-3+deb.sury.org~yakkety+1 (cli) (built: Mar 25 2017 14:01:32) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2017 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.1.3-3+deb.sury.org~yakkety+1, Copyright (c) 1999-2017, by Zend Technologies
```

##### Modules
OPCache was enabled and the installation was the default one without any modifications in `php.ini`. The modules installed were:

```bash
calendar, Core, ctype, curl, date, dom, exif, fileinfo, filter, ftp, gettext, hash, iconv, intl, json, libxml, mbstring, mcrypt, openssl, pcntl, pcre, PDO, phalcon, Phar, posix, readline, Reflection, session, shmop, SimpleXML, sockets , SPL, standard, sysvmsg, sysvsem, sysvshm, tokenizer, wddx, xml, xmlreader, xmlwriter, xsl, Zend OPcache, zlib
```

#### Frameworks
The frameworks compared were:
- [FuelPHP (v1.8.0)](https://fuelphp.com/)
- [Kohana (v3.3.6)](http://kohanaframework.org/index)
- [Laravel (v5.4)](https://laravel.com/)
- [Nette (v2.4)](https://nette.org/)
- [Phalcon (v3.1.2)](https://phalconphp.com/en/)
- [Symfony (v3.2)](http://symfony.com)
- [Yii (v2.0.11)](www.yiiframework.com)
- [Zend Framework (v.3.0.1)](https://framework.zend.com/)

#### Installation and Changes
We tried to make this test as realistic as possible, ensuring that all frameworks behave in production mode. However, nobody is perfect so any suggestions that the community can provide to tweak each framework to its maximum potential, feel free to issue a pull request in our [Github repository](https://github.com/phalcon/framework-bench).
