With the upcoming [release in a week or so of 0.7.0](/post/phalcon-0-7-0-beta-released) and the interfaces functionality attached to it, we have created a new repository in github called Phalcon Incubator:

[https://github.com/phalcon/incubator](https://github.com/phalcon/incubator)

<!--more-->
In this repository - which is all PHP code - we welcome submissions from the community of snippets that could extend the framework more. For instance we have already posted a [database session handler](https://github.com/phalcon/incubator/tree/master/Library/Phalcon/Session/Adapter) that everyone can use (just check the repository).

The only thing we ask is to document your submission as much as possible so that you can give others the opportunity to understand and use your code.

Popular contributions will be considered as potential candidates for inclusion in the extension in C.

Enjoy!
