> Greetings to the Phalcon Team!
> 
> I am a 20 year veteran of corporate software development and I have followed Phalcon PHP with much excitement from it's early days till now.
> 
> Over the past 2 years we have created [https://r8em.co.za](https://r8em.co.za) as your platform to rate anything. Initially targeting local businesses and growing it into an international offering down the line.
> 
> The platform is a hybrid of technologies but uses a multi-module Phalcon setup running on Nginx servers scaling on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. We are also using Phalcon's database and caching abilities including a myriad of other features to deliver content to our expected 100,000+ concurrent users. Our current dataset includes roughly 30 million records on MariaDB and we serve high-speed sub-second searches using ElasticSearch. I am really happy that I made the move to Phalcon years ago and would recommend it to anyone considering themselves an expert in "best of breed" technologies.

> Thank you Phalcon Team for all your hard work! You have made my life so much easier when it comes to deciding on a high-performance, feature-rich web development framework.
> 
> Looking forward to many more years and greater adoption of Phalcon PHP by some of the big players.

> Best regards
