### History

It has been a very long journey. We started over a year ago working on v4, putting forward a bold implementation that will act as the foundation of future Phalcon releases.

361 days ago we released our first alpha version (v4.0.0.alpha1) and since then we continued developing, adding new functionality, fixing design flaws, rewriting the codebase to take advantage of speed enhancements as well as stricter types for variables.

We are really happy that we finally got to the end of the road and can now release **Phalcon v4.0.0 Stable**
