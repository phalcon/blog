We are releasing the third alpha version today, a lot of additions as well as bug fixes. You can see our project [here](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/projects/3)

In case you missed it, there are two discussions going on on Github regarding our new [Queue](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/issues/13851) component and the direction to take, as well as voting for [upcoming features](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/issues/13855) priority. We would welcome any input.
