Yet another success story from our community member Michael ([Xpundel](https://github.com/xpundel)).

> Greetings, Phalcon team!
>
> As I wrote in comments to your post, I have a project, built on Phalcon framework.
>
> It's a Guitarama ([http://guitarama.ru](http://guitarama.ru)) - guitars tabs and chords catalog. The site is aimed towards Russian audience, and uses the Russian language, but I hope, there will be no problem to understand most of pages.
>
> The site was re-launched using Phalcon at the beginning of January, 2013 and has since shown steady attendance growth. The Google stats can be found here.
>
> The site use Twig as the template engine (historical reasons), but I recently realized that the speed of Twig does not suit the site, in the near future I plan to replace it with Volt.Â 
>
> There are still a lot of optimizations to do, and work on the project is constantly in process.
>
> Once again, thank you for a great framework and all what you are doing :)
>
> Best regards,
>
> Michael.

**NOTE**: The site is running on a server with a **P4 processor @3GHz** and **4Gb RAM**
