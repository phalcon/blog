All repositories related to Zephir, which were inside `phalcon` Github organization were transferred to `zephir-lang` organization. 
<!--more-->

This transfer should have been done in past, but due Github's limitations at that time, it was decided to keep them inside `phalcon`.

List of repositories that were transferred:

* [zephir](https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir)
* [php-zephir-parser](https://github.com/zephir-lang/php-zephir-parser)
* [zephir-atom](https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir-atom)
* [zephir-lexer](https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir-lexer)
* [zephir-atom](https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir-atom)
