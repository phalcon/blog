I'm happy to announce the release of my article dedicated to Phalcon in a French magazine called Programmez.

Even though the article is in French, it us great to see the title : **Phalcon : le nouveau framework PHP à connaître** - **Phalcon : the new PHP framework to know** on the cover of the magazine.

The article is eight pages long, in which I am presenting Phalcon and Zephir, as well as showcasing  Phalcon's main features.

This edition is available for two months (June-July 2020). You can find it on [the magazine's website.](https://www.programmez.com/magazine/programmez-241-pdf)

Thank you! I hope this article contributes to increasing Phalcon's community !
