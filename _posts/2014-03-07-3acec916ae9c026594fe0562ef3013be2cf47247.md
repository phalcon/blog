We are humans. We want to better ourselves. Taking different paths and exploring new opportunities we all want to make the world a better place for everyone that lives in it.

This has been the drive of many innovators throughout the years, who, through determination and hard work, made a difference, changed minds, offering tools and ideas that made and make our lives easier.

Two years ago (actually our two year anniversary was in January but this will do), a crazy idea was formed, to create the fastest and most feature rich PHP framework as a PHP extension.

Phalcon was born.

[*3ACEC916AE9C026594FE0562EF3013BE2CF47247*](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/commit/3acec916ae9c026594fe0562ef3013be2cf47247) marks one of the first commits made in the cphalcon repository in Github, but in fact, one of the most significant because it declared our mission starting that day.

Very early days back then, extremely few followers, a lot of things to learn, many bugs and many features missing.

Since then, so many things have happened, we have been delighted to see new contributors to our project, new testers, new users and new applications every day.

Thank you all! Without you we could have not gone this far. 

Happy birthday Phalcon Project!
