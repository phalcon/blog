Amazing projects need amazing tools. We might not know you just yet, but we think you'd be a great fit for building a better web. Together, we're ready to change the world!

We hope that you enjoy Phalcon as much as we do. Our doors are always open to receive your collaboration with the many things a project like this requires:

**Documentation**
The repository of this website is available on [github](http://github.com/phalcon/docs). Feel free to improve it, fix typos, add examples, add articles, etc. Also, if you can translate some of the content to another language, it will be very much appreciated!

**Screencasts**
We all love screencasts, if you have some extra time and want to support the community with some nice videos teaching any framework's feature, it's very welcome. Check out our [Vimeo Channel](https://vimeo.com/user10964377) as a guide.

**Testing**
No software is free of bugs, if you find out any, please do not hesitate to tell us. We have a testsuite with more than [8000 tests](https://travis-ci.org/phalcon/cphalcon). However, unit-tests are never enough. Help us to improve our testsuite by adding more tests or improve the current ones. Every added test make the framework more stable and avoid introduce bugs by mistake or break something that is currently working. The overall stability of the frameworks highly depends on our tests.

**Sample Applications**
Big examples help others to better understand how big things can be created with Phalcon, feel free to share repositories with sample applications helping others with their work, allow others to give you feedback about your work too!

**Evangelism**
There are a lot of people that still don't know that Phalcon exist or it really works. We are certain that many developers will benefit from hearing what Phalcon is all about and how it can help them.

Who does not want to know about the tool that is going to revolutionize PHP development?
