Summer
Slow progress
Team focused on work/family mostly
vacations
nikos had 2 weeks of vacation, the first vacation he had in the last 5 years. well deserved, and really nice to spend time with the family. Ruud and Serghei also had vacations and Anton is getting ready.

as last year summer is slow moving and with covid, we have slow progress. some people were not even allowed to go out of the house without a mask. crazy world we live in. everything is thrown upside down

Team focused mostly on work and family mostly and due to vactions things slowed down.

Team changes
Serghei is stepping down and cannot commit time to the project. He needs to concentrate on work and family of course. He was very nice to tell us that he will no longer be able to help - not fooling anyone Huge thank you to him for all the work he has done. v3 support solo. Team remains dedicated for the project as time permits. 

Zephir
We have an issue. We do not have maintainers
Zephir invented for contributions
not many wanted to help with it so the language became stagnant, difficult to maintain with a lot of bugs that cannot be fixed unless Zephir is redesigned
Development will be put on hold
Not expecting to be compatible with php 8
maintainers are moce than welcome


Phalcon
It cannot be maintained any more without zephir being developed.
We will switch to pure php implementation in phalcon 5


phalcon 4.1 will continue and we will decide what we will release (see project in github). it will support up to php 7.4

phlalcon 5
pure php
install with composer
backwards compatible, as much as possible
php 7.4/8.0 (alpha)
keeping with current phalcon goals (performance, low overhead, ease of use)
parsers need to be rewritten
cardoe to be used as a starting point. what is cardoe

adr pattern as scheduled around v4
will aim for 100% code coverage and tests
opens up the possiblity for async (future)

we do not know how easy or difficult the task to rewrite the parsers is. It will be try and see.

v4 bugs, v5 requirements, v5 design, what we will reuse and what not
