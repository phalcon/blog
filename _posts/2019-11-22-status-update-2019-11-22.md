A quick update for this week and the next one regarding v4 and what we have been up to since our last blog post, brought to you by the Phalcon Team :)

<!--more-->

### v4
Business as usual. Work is continuing on bugs, minimal functionality and testing. Many thanks to our contributors who via GitHub or Discord reported issues with v4.0.0.RC3.

We already have addressed inconsistencies with interfaces and additional bugs found. As you can see in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/4.0.x/CHANGELOG-4.0.md) we already have 10 fixes there :)

3 more cards need to be checked and fixed (if found to be bugs) to finish outstanding issues (unless we get any additional reports).

### Docs
The documents are nearly done!! Remaining:

- `DevTools` document which will be done after our DevTools is fully compatible with v4.
- `REST API Advanced`. A tutorial based on our [REST API](https://github.com/phalcon/rest-api) application (in progress)
- `Firewall`

We have been correcting some of the documents as we find typos or inconsistencies. 

Of course, everyone is welcome to review our documentation and offer suggestions, ask questions, point out inconsistencies and omissions etc.

Our documents for v4 are live here:

[https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/introduction](https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/introduction)

The status of the documentation project can be seen [here](https://github.com/phalcon/docs/issues/2322). If you wish to issue a pull request with corrections, please visit our [docs](https://github.com/phalcon/docs) repository and issue your pull request for the English language only (`en` directory).

### Holidays
To all of our friends in the US, we wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving for next week!

Nikos will be taking a week off and will be returning next weekend. Ruud and Serghei will be around.
