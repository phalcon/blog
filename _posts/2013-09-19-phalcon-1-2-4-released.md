In addition to 2.0, the Phalcon Team is also focused on 1.3, a new version that will include new features, important improvements in the overall memory usage and new components like `Phalcon\Image`.

Today, we are announcing the release of Phalcon 1.2.4, a maintenance release including several bug fixes, performance improvements and stability fixes available in the 1.3.0 branch.
