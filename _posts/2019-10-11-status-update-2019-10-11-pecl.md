A quick update on v4, PECL, docs and sample apps, brought to you by the Phalcon Team :)

<!--more-->

### PECL

We are excited to announce that we now have an account with [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/)!

We have been trying for years to get this account so that we can offer an easier and faster way for users to install Phalcon but were not successful. However after nearly 10 requests, the PECL team has approved our submission and we are now in business!

Our page is: <https://pecl.php.net/package/Phalcon>

There is still a lot of work to be done to prepare Phalcon for PECL and we will need to work on updating the relevant page in the PHP manual, but the most difficult part is done!

### RC

We have been working hard to fix issues and offer minimum enhancements for v4. As you can see in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/4.0.x/CHANGELOG-4.0.md) a lot has been added since RC1.

We thank the community for contributing to these issues! You guys are the best.

We will be releasing RC2 most likely this week coming.

### Sample Apps

[Vokuro](https://github.com/phalcon/vokuro) and [REST API](https://github.com/phalcon/rest-api) have been upgraded to v4. We are now working on the \[DevTools](https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools).

### Documentation

We are continuing to review and revise all of our documents. The status of this effort can be seen [here](https://github.com/phalcon/docs/issues/2322). As you can see we have around 30 documents to review and revise.

If you would like to help with the revisions for the documentation, go to the above issue and pick any of the documents (`en/` folder) and issue a pull request!

### Social Media

We are present in pretty much all the social networks out there. Feel free to follow us for updates and news:
