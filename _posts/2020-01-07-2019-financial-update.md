Since we have been accepting financial contributions from our community, we would like to present a financial update, so as to showcase where those funds are used and why.

<!--more-->

This is the first financial post we are presenting but we intend on making a habit of this and have a post for each year to keep the community and our financial contributors informed on where the project stands.

You can always check the status of our finances in our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/phalcon) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://phalcon.io/fund) pages at any time.

## Overview

In short we have a good amount of funds available to us. We are also very stingy on where we spend it. As of today, our balance is 14,896.40 USD. The money is used primarily to sponsor development (Phalcon and Zephir) and purchase services that we need (for instance email service etc.). In the future we might consider sponsoring travel or conferences of core members, but that is not set yet.

## In Detail

For the information below, *net income* reflects the money that are available for the project, while *collected* reflects the money that has been paid by contributors. The difference is to cover the fees of Open Collective as well as Credit Card processors etc.

All amounts are in USD.
